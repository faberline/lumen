## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

id: native-search-offset-verification
requirements:
  cursor_exclusivity:
    id: R2
    text: "A non-zero offset cannot be combined with an opaque cursor and returns a clear client error."

    verify: cargo test -p lumen storage::sorted_offset_tests -- --nocapture
  global_shard_offset:
    id: R3
    text: "Shard routing applies offset only after global ordering and exposes the canonical OpenAPI field."

  sorted_offset_slice:
