summary: Adopt the completed shared stateful-service foundations while preserving Lumen domain policy and compatibility.
capability_refs:
  - id: long-running-stability
    role: primary
    claim: shared-stateful-foundation-adoption
    coverage: full
    rationale: "This TD dependency-orders #1640-#1645 and verifies every Lumen adapter plus the remaining OTLP and peer-listener runtime wiring."
