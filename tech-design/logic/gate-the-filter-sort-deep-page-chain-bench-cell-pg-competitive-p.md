id: lumen-filter-sort-deep-page-gate
summary: >
  Gate the filter + sort + deep-page search chain so keyset cursor pagination
  stays depth-invariant and cannot regress back to O(offset) page walks. The
  slice adds a `sorted_page_deep` lumen-bench cell, wires it into the
  Postgres/OpenSearch competitive gate, adds a rig data-table browse scenario,
  and records the gate in the README capability inventory.

      The filter + sort + cursor path is the performance promise issue #10
      exists to protect.

    coverage: partial
    rationale: >
      The same sorted-keyset planner must stay correct and fast for exact
      search browse flows.
