# Standardized apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

Public API manifest for `apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs`.

### Symbols

| Name | Target | Kind | Visibility | Line | Signature |
|------|--------|------|------------|------|-----------|
| `DriveOutcome` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | enum | pub | 820 | #1458 R1: gained `AwaitingTopologyConvergence { map_version: u64 }` and `TopologyConverged { map_version: u64 }` variants, returned by the new `Complete`-phase `advance_convergence` step. |
| `KubeClusterControl` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | struct | pub | 638 |  |
| `OversizedDocumentBlock` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | struct | pub | 264 | #1444 R2: distinguishes an apply failure caused by exactly one document's batch serializing past `crate::reshard::ADMIN_ROUTE_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` (the `snapshot_reshard_batches`/`byte_cap_chunk` floor case) from any other reason `POST /admin/reshard:apply` can fail — surfaced as a distinct `status.reshard` blocking condition and used to skip re-arming the write-pause fence on a tick already known to fail identically. |
| `compute_target_map` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 935 | compute_target_map(current: &VirtualBucketShardMap) -> Result<VirtualBucketShardMap> |
| `convergence_stall_budget_secs` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 448 | #1485 R2: the production [`CONVERGENCE_STALL_SECS`] wall-clock stall-budget value, exposed so `reconcile.rs`'s tests and `reshard_driver_e2e.rs` can back-date `workflow.convergenceWaitStartedAt` past the real budget without sleeping. convergence_stall_budget_secs() -> u64 |
| `convergence_stall_condition` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 541 | #1485 R2: whether an `awaitingTopologyConvergence` wait that began at the given `workflow.convergenceWaitStartedAt` value has run longer than [`CONVERGENCE_STALL_SECS`] — computed purely from that one persisted CR timestamp (not driver memory), so `reconcile.rs`'s `status_patch` reports the same `topologyConvergenceStalled` condition whether or not the driver process has restarted since the wait began. convergence_stall_condition(wait_started_at: Option<u64>) -> bool |
| `current_shard_map` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 920 | current_shard_map(lumen: &Lumen) -> Result<VirtualBucketShardMap> |
| `default_write_fence_ttl_secs` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 234 | #1443 R1/AC1: the production default [`ClusterControl::write_fence_ttl_secs`] value, exposed so integration tests can fall back to the real default from a `fence_ttl_secs: Option<u64>`-style override field without needing the private `WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS` const itself to be `pub`. default_write_fence_ttl_secs() -> u64 |
| `drive_tick` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 2348 | #1458 R1: the `Complete`-phase branch now calls `clear_oversize_block` then `advance_convergence` before falling through to `should_start_split`/`NoOp`, so a completed cutover keeps driving `AwaitingTopologyConvergence`/`TopologyConverged` outcomes until every serving pod is confirmed Ready on the new topology. drive_tick(     control: &dyn ClusterControl,     http: &reqwest::Client,     lumen: &Lumen, ) -> DriveOutcome |
| `new` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 644 | new(client: Client) -> Self |
| `oversize_block_condition` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 399 | #1444 R2 / #1458 R4: now keyed by `(namespace, name, uid)` — the oversized-document block currently recorded for the live CR identified by its `metadata.uid`, if any, so a deleted-and-recreated same-name CR never inherits a stale wedge cached under the old uid. `reconcile.rs`'s `status_patch` calls this to layer a distinct `status.reshard` blocking condition + remediation message onto the policy/usage-derived status. oversize_block_condition(namespace: &str, name: &str, uid: &str) -> Option<OversizedDocumentBlock> |
| `run_migration_pass` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 1411 | One migration pass: every bucket `bucket_moves` says moved, fetched via `POST /admin/backup:scoped` and applied to its new owner via `POST /admin/reshard:apply` (`snapshot_reshard_batches` builds the bounded, purely-additive batches — #1457 R1). Thin wrapper over the shared `run_migration_pass_impl(..., final_pass: bool, moving_buckets: Option<&BTreeSet<u32>>)`, called here with `final_pass=false`; the final fenced `CatchingUp` pass calls `run_migration_pass_impl` directly with `final_pass=true` to additionally send each moved bucket's authoritative-replace scope via `POST /admin/reshard:prune` (`snapshot_reshard_prune_chunks`). #1458 R3: `run_migration_pass_impl` now re-arms the write-pause fence on a time basis (whenever more than TTL/4 has elapsed since the last arm) rather than a fixed batch-count interval. run_migration_pass(     control: &dyn ClusterControl,     http: &reqwest::Client,     namespace: &str,     name: &str,     lumen: &Lumen, ) -> Result<usize> |
| `should_start_split` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 857 | #1396 R5: also requires `status.reshard.usage_measured_at_map_version == spec.shardMap.version` — a lagging/stale status subresource can never start a split. should_start_split(lumen: &Lumen) -> bool |
| `spawn_reshard_driver_loop` | apps/lumen/src/operator/reshard_driver.rs | function | pub | 2395 | #1458 R4: the live-CR listing now also drives `prune_oversize_cache`, dropping any cached oversize-block entry whose uid is no longer among the live CRs' `metadata.uid`s. spawn_reshard_driver_loop(client: Client) |

Not listed above (matching this project's existing mirrors' convention of
only capturing top-level `pub` structs/enums/consts/modules and inherent-impl
`pub fn`s, never trait definitions, trait methods, or trait-impl methods):
the `pub trait ClusterControl` definition and its methods (including
`shard_base_url`, the #1443 R1 `write_fence_ttl_secs` default-impl method,
which returns the private `WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS` const unless a test fake
overrides it, and the new #1458 R1 `serving_topology_converged` method,
which reports whether every serving pod is confirmed `Ready` on the current
shard-map topology), and `KubeClusterControl`'s `impl ClusterControl for
KubeClusterControl` block. Also not listed (private): `checkpoint_shard`
(#1389, rewritten #1396 R3 to require `persisted == true`) and
`checkpoint_shards` (#1389 as `checkpoint_touched_shards`, generalized and
renamed by #1396 R1 to take an explicit shard set — called once for just
the target shard right after migration, and again for every source shard
after eviction; #1458 R3 adds an in-loop time-based re-arm check via
`maybe_rearm_fence` around each shard's checkpoint/prune step), plus three
#1396 R1/R2 private helpers: `reshard_fence_call`, `set_write_fence`
(arm/clear `POST /admin/reshard:fence` on every current source shard;
rewritten by #1443 R4 to track which shards it has successfully armed and
best-effort clear them before returning an error, so a mid-sequence arm
failure never leaves a partially-fenced cluster), and
`advance_catching_up_fenced` (the actual migrate -> checkpoint(target) ->
evict -> checkpoint(sources) -> cutover sequence `advance_catching_up`
brackets with a fence arm/clear; #1443 R1 adds intra-sequence re-arm calls
before each of those steps so a slow real pass — checkpoints, evictions —
never outlives a single TTL window, and a failed re-arm aborts to `Blocked`
before the next step runs rather than silently reopening the write window).
Also not listed (private, new, #1458 R3): `FENCE_REARM_FRACTION` const
(replaces the retired `FENCE_REARM_BATCH_INTERVAL` count-based const — a
re-arm now fires whenever more than `write_fence_ttl_secs() /
FENCE_REARM_FRACTION` has elapsed since the last arm, checked between batch
applies in `run_migration_pass_impl` and around each fetch/checkpoint/prune
step in `checkpoint_shards`), `maybe_rearm_fence` (the shared elapsed-time
re-arm helper both call), and the `default_write_fence_ttl_secs`-backing
`WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS` const itself. Also not listed (private, new, #1458
R1): `buckets_on_newest_shard` (reads `buckets_on_newest_shard` off a
`VirtualBucketShardMap` for the `serving_topology_converged` desired-replica
math) and `advance_convergence` (the `Complete`-phase driver: returns `None`
when there is nothing to converge or convergence already landed; otherwise
re-arms/clears the write-pause fence around a
`ClusterControl::serving_topology_converged` probe and, on success, patches
`status.reshard.convergedShardMapVersion`/`spec.reshardPolicy.workflow.convergedShardMapVersion`
so convergence state is derived from persisted state, not driver memory, and
is resumable across a driver restart). Also not listed (private/`pub(crate)`,
#1444 R2, re-keyed by #1458 R4): `OVERSIZE_RECHECK_TICKS` const, the
`OversizeBlockCache` type alias (`pub(crate) fn prune_oversize_cache`, new
#1458 R4, drops any cached entry whose uid is absent from a live-CR
`BTreeSet<String>` of uids, called from `spawn_reshard_driver_loop`'s
per-tick live-CR listing and whenever a workflow returns to phase
`Complete`), `oversize_block_cache`, `oversize_cache_key` (private, now
keyed by `(namespace, name)` with the uid carried as the cached tuple's
first element so a uid mismatch is detected without changing the cache's
key shape), `record_oversize_block` and `clear_oversize_block`
(`pub(crate)` rather than private so `reconcile.rs`'s `status_patch` tests
can drive the exact cache `oversize_block_condition` reads, without
widening either past crate-internal visibility; `record_oversize_block`
now takes the CR's `uid` as an explicit argument), `should_skip_for_oversize`
(private; the mutating cache read/write helpers backing
`oversize_block_condition`, now uid-aware), and `detect_oversized_batch`
(pre-flight oversize check called from `apply_reshard_batch`, which now
returns the downcastable `OversizedDocumentBlock` error instead of only a
generic `bail!` on both the pre-flight miss and a live 413 response). Also
not listed (private, #1457 R1/R2, new): `run_migration_pass_impl` (the
shared `final_pass: bool` implementation `run_migration_pass` now wraps),
`fetch_all_collection_ids` (fetches a source shard's complete `GET
/collections` id list independently of the bucket-scoped snapshot, so
`snapshot_reshard_prune_chunks` can seed an empty `keep_ids` scope for a
collection a moved bucket emptied entirely — #1457 R2), and
`apply_reshard_prune_chunk` (this driver's `POST /admin/reshard:prune`
caller for one `ReshardPruneChunk`, mirroring `apply_reshard_batch`'s
existing `POST /admin/reshard:apply` caller). Also not listed (#1467 R5/R7,
new): the `ClusterControl::serving_pods_report_map_version` trait method
(default-impl `Ok(true)`; `KubeClusterControl`'s impl scrapes every serving
pod's `/metrics` for `lumen_shard_map_version == map_version`, gated behind
`rollout_converged` so it only scrapes once the StatefulSet rollout itself
has finished), `advance_convergence`'s now-two-stage check (`rollout_converged`
from `serving_topology_converged`, then `converged` from
`serving_pods_report_map_version`) and its `workflow.
lastCutoverShardMapVersion`-gated engagement (the only writer is
`advance_catching_up_fenced`'s cutover patch, closing the gap where
convergence would otherwise fence indefinitely over a hand-authored/restored
`spec.shardMap`), `evict_old_shards`'s new `moving_buckets`/`last_armed_at`
parameters (an in-loop time-based fence re-arm via `maybe_rearm_fence` before
every old-shard eviction call, not just once at the phase boundary), and
(private/`pub(crate)`) `CONVERGENCE_STALL_TICKS` const, `ConvergenceStallCache`
type alias, `convergence_stall_cache`/`convergence_stall_key`, and
`pub(crate) record_convergence_await`/`clear_convergence_stall`/
`prune_convergence_stall_cache` (the driver-memory-only consecutive-tick
budget tracker `reconcile.rs`'s tests previously drove directly; #1485 R2
keeps this cache as a fast-path/logging-only signal). Also not listed
(#1485 R1/R2, new): (private) `now_epoch_secs` (the `SystemTime::now()`
epoch-seconds helper backing every durable timestamp this module stamps),
and the `workflow.convergenceWaitStartedAt`/`convergenceRemediationRestartCount`/
`convergenceRemediationRestartedAt` read/patch logic `advance_convergence`
now threads through its not-yet-converged branch — the durable stall budget
and bounded one-shot remediation-restart re-trigger both `convergence_stall_
budget_secs` and `convergence_stall_condition` (table above) expose the pure
parts of.

````rust
// SPEC-MANAGED: apps/lumen/tech-design/semantic/source/projects-lumen-src-operator-reshard-driver-rs.md#rust-source-unit
// CODEGEN-BEGIN
//! Autonomous reshard phase driver (#1319 R2 executor; #1381).
//!
//! [`super::reconcile`]'s live per-shard usage loop only *reports* a crossed
//! `prepareAtPercent` / `urgentAtPercent` threshold into
//! `status.reshard.blockingConditions`; this module is the piece that acts on
//! it — a second, independently leader-gated background loop that drives
//! `spec.reshardPolicy.workflow.phase` through
//! `PrepareSplit -> Splitting -> CatchingUp -> Complete`, growing storage by
//! exactly one physical shard per split via [`crate::routing::
//! VirtualBucketShardMap::split_one_shard`] and moving data with the already
//!-landed admin verbs (`POST /admin/backup:scoped`, `POST
//! /admin/reshard:apply`, `POST /admin/reshard:evict`, #1380).
//!
//! ## Checkpointing and resume
//!
//! There is no separate checkpoint record. Every phase's actions are
//! recomputed deterministically from three already-persisted **spec** fields
//! — `reshardPolicy.workflow.phase`, `reshardPolicy.workflow.
//! targetShardCount`, and `shardMap` (left untouched until the cutover) —
//! plus `shardCount`. `spec` (not `status`) is the checkpoint because it is
//! the operator's own desired-state write target and survives an operator
//! restart or leader handover unchanged; `status` stays a read-only
//! projection. Concretely:
//!
//! - **Complete** (idle): [`should_start_split`] gates on a crossed
//!   threshold (`status.reshard.blockingConditions` already carries
//!   `prepareThresholdCrossed` / `urgentThresholdCrossed`, computed by
//!   [`super::crd::LumenSpec::reshard_status_with_usage`]), `maxShardBytes`
//!   set (R3 safety rail — recommendation-only otherwise), single-member
//!   (`replicasPerShard <= 1`; see below), and no `maxShards` ceiling
//!   reached. On a match: compute the target map, patch `shardCount` and
//!   `workflow.{phase,targetShardCount}` in one merge patch, phase ->
//!   `PrepareSplit`.
//! - **PrepareSplit**: wait for the StatefulSet's `readyReplicas` to reach
//!   `targetShardCount` (the new pod exists once `shardCount` is bumped, via
//!   the *existing*, independently-leader-gated `libs/operator` apply loop —
//!   this driver never applies child objects itself). Once ready, phase ->
//!   `Splitting`. Restart-safe: re-reads the same live readiness fact every
//!   tick.
//! - **Splitting**: run one migration pass ([`run_migration_pass`] — the
//!   production caller of [`crate::reshard::bucket_moves`] /
//!   [`crate::reshard::snapshot_reshard_batches`]) copying every moved
//!   bucket from its old shard to the new shard via the admin verbs, then
//!   phase -> `CatchingUp`. `POST /admin/reshard:apply` is an idempotent
//!   additive merge (#1380), so re-running this same pass after a restart
//!   (still `Splitting`) is safe and simply re-applies the same batches.
//! - **CatchingUp** ([`advance_catching_up`], resequenced by #1396 R1/R2):
//!   arm a write-pause fence over every still-moving bucket on its current
//!   (source) owner (R2, see below), run the *same* migration pass again —
//!   an idempotent re-sync that, under the fence, is guaranteed a converged
//!   snapshot of every moving bucket — checkpoint **only the new/target
//!   shard** durably, evict every moved bucket from every old shard
//!   ([`crate::reshard`]'s `evict` is also idempotent), checkpoint every
//!   **source** shard durably, then flip `spec.shardMap` to the target map
//!   in the same patch that clears `workflow.targetShardCount` and resets
//!   phase -> `Complete`, followed by [`trigger_rolling_restart`], then
//!   clear the fence (unconditionally, on every exit path). Calling evict
//!   against the **new**, already-committed map (not the stale old one)
//!   means the driver never needs to retain the old map across a restart —
//!   the source of the classic "lost the old map after cutover" resumability
//!   trap. Checkpointing the target *before* evicting sources — rather than
//!   checkpointing everything only after both migration and eviction, as
//!   this driver did before #1396 — is R1: an eviction becoming durable (or
//!   even being attempted) before the target's copy of the same data is
//!   durably checkpointed can lose data that exists on no durable shard at
//!   all if the process crashes in between; see [`advance_catching_up`]'s
//!   own doc for the full crash-at-every-step analysis.
//!
//! A driver-side error at any step ([`DriveOutcome::Blocked`]) leaves the CR
//! spec untouched; the next tick retries the same phase from the same
//! persisted fields (R3).
//!
//! ## Write-pause fence during the final CatchingUp pass (#1396 R2)
//!
//! Even with the `Splitting` + `CatchingUp` double migration pass, a write
//! that lands on a moved bucket's old (source) shard after the *last*
//! migration-copy read but before that bucket's eviction is never re-copied
//! anywhere — eviction then silently drops it. [`advance_catching_up`] closes
//! this gap with a bounded, status-visible write pause (the mechanism #1381's
//! R5 review sanctioned: "a bounded final pause of writes to still-moving
//! buckets is acceptable if needed for convergence, but must be bounded and
//! reported in status") rather than a repeat-until-converged loop: arming the
//! fence *before* the tick's migration pass means that single pass is already
//! a complete snapshot of every fenced bucket, because no write can land on
//! them while it runs. [`crate::api::WriteFence`] (`POST
//! /admin/reshard:fence`) is the serving-side seam; a fenced write gets `503
//! bucket_write_paused` rather than being silently dropped or racing the map
//! flip. The fence is armed on every **source** shard (the live owners until
//! this tick's own cutover patch), and cleared — unconditionally, on every
//! exit path of [`advance_catching_up`], success or `Blocked` — once the
//! sequence finishes. A driver process that crashes before that explicit
//! clear cannot wedge writes forever: [`WriteFence::blocks`] enforces
//! [`WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS`] as a deadline on the *serving* pod itself,
//! independent of the driver's liveness.
//!
//! ## Migration durability (#1389)
//!
//! `Engine::apply_reshard_batch`/`evict_not_owned` (`storage.rs`, #1380)
//! mutate engine state directly rather than through `WriteCoordinator`/the
//! AOF, so — unlike ordinary writes — their durability is not implied by the
//! engine's normal write path; with #1387's embedded persistence it was
//! previously captured only by the next periodic `LUMEN_SNAPSHOT_SECS`
//! checkpoint (default 300s), well after this driver's own cutover restart
//! (~60-90s later) — observed live as 806 migrated batches lost on the
//! target and an eviction silently undone on the source (#1387's report).
//!
//! Two designs were considered: (a) route `:apply`/`:evict` through the AOF/
//! `WriteCoordinator` path as new `RaftLogEntry` variants, or (b) an explicit
//! synchronous checkpoint step the driver invokes and awaits per touched
//! shard before cutover. **(b) was chosen**: a whole `ReshardBatch`'s
//! `SnapshotV1` delta can be large (bounded by `MAX_EXTERNAL_IDS_PER_BATCH`,
//! but still potentially many collections/fields), which sits awkwardly as a
//! single `WalRecord`/AOF frame designed around one bounded mutation
//! (`Index`/`ReplaceDocs`/etc); it would also need new apply-loop branches
//! and idempotency semantics distinct from every existing `RaftLogEntry`
//! variant, whose apply methods mutate exactly one collection deterministically
//! rather than merge a whole delta. (b) reuses `segment_rdb.rs`'s
//! `SegmentRdbStore::save` verbatim — the exact call the periodic snapshotter
//! already makes, just invoked synchronously on demand via a new
//! `POST /admin/checkpoint` admin verb ([`crate::api::CheckpointSink`]) — no
//! new WAL record shape, no new apply-loop branch, no new idempotency
//! reasoning: `save` already re-seals the *entire* current engine state
//! (including whatever `:apply`/`:evict` already mutated) atomically
//! (stage-then-rename), so one checkpoint call captures every migration
//! mutation made so far, not just the most recent one.
//!
//! [`checkpoint_shards`] calls `POST /admin/checkpoint` on an explicit shard
//! set; [`advance_catching_up_fenced`] calls it twice per tick — once for
//! just the new/target shard immediately after migration and before any
//! source eviction is attempted (#1396 R1), and again for every source shard
//! (`0..current.physical_shard_count()`, `evict_old_shards`'s target set)
//! after eviction and before the `shardMap` cutover patch and
//! [`trigger_rolling_restart`]. A checkpoint failure on either call reports
//! [`DriveOutcome::Blocked`] and leaves `spec` at `CatchingUp` untouched
//! (R3): the next tick re-runs the whole idempotent
//! migrate/checkpoint/evict/checkpoint sequence, consistent with #1381's
//! spec-is-the-checkpoint semantics — cutover never fires on a shard whose
//! migration mutations are not yet durable, and eviction is never even
//! attempted before the target's copy of the same data is durable.
//! `checkpoint_shard` (#1396 R3) also now requires the response body to
//! report `persisted == true`; a `200 {"persisted": false}` — the vacuous
//! "no durable store configured" response `admin_checkpoint` returns for
//! [`crate::api::NoopCheckpoint`] deployments — is treated as a failed
//! checkpoint, not a satisfied durability gate.
//!
//! ## Scope rail: single-member only
//!
//! [`should_start_split`] refuses to start a split when `replicasPerShard >
//! 1`. Growing `shardCount` reassigns `shard_index = ordinal % shardCount`
//! for *every* existing pod ordinal once raft has more than one replica per
//! shard (a full raft-group reshuffle, not an added shard), which is unsafe
//! without additional raft-membership migration this WI does not implement.
//! At `replicasPerShard <= 1`, `ordinal % (shardCount+1) == ordinal` for
//! every existing ordinal (`ordinal < shardCount`), so growing by exactly
//! one is pod-ordinal-stable: every existing pod keeps its shard/PVC
//! identity and exactly one new pod (ordinal == old `shardCount`) becomes
//! the new shard — see [`super::crd::LumenSpec::storage_pod_count`].
//!
//! ## Live query routing consumes `spec.shardMap` (#1384)
//!
//! [`super::render::render`] writes `shardMap.{version,assignments}` into the
//! serving ConfigMap, `serving_env` maps `SHARD_MAP_VERSION`/
//! `VIRTUAL_BUCKET_COUNT`/`SHARD_MAP_ASSIGNMENTS` onto container env, and
//! `src/bin/lumen.rs`'s `serve()` builds its `EngineShardSearch` via
//! `EngineShardSearch::new_with_shard_map` fed by
//! `crate::config::shard_map_from_env`, so a pod started after this driver's
//! cutover routes queries by the minimal-move target map computed by
//! [`crate::routing::VirtualBucketShardMap::split_one_shard`] rather than the
//! balanced default. [`trigger_rolling_restart`] is driven in the same
//! cutover tick that patches `spec.shardMap` so every serving pod picks up
//! the new map without manual intervention: it patches the serving
//! StatefulSet's pod-template annotations, which Kubernetes' native
//! `RollingUpdate` strategy (`serving_statefulset`'s `updateStrategy`) turns
//! into a rolling recreation of every pod against the already-updated
//! ConfigMap — no separate watch/poll loop is needed.

/// - Crash after the target checkpoint, before eviction: the target already
///   durably holds the moved data; retry replays migrate (no-op) and the
///   target checkpoint (no-op re-confirm), then proceeds to evict.
/// - Crash after eviction (RAM-only until its own checkpoint), before the
///   source checkpoint: even if the pod restart the driver is about to
///   trigger loses the in-RAM eviction, a retry is still safe — the target
///   already durably has the moved data from the earlier target checkpoint,

///   source checkpoint retries until it succeeds. Eviction is never durable
///   nor attempted before the target's copy is durable, so this crash can

      #1381 (#1319 R2 executor): new autonomous reshard phase driver.
      Checkpointed, resumable state machine over `spec.reshardPolicy.
      workflow.phase` (`Complete -> PrepareSplit -> Splitting -> CatchingUp
      -> Complete`), gated by `should_start_split` (R3 safety rails:
      `maxShardBytes` must be set, single-member only, `maxShards` ceiling
      respected). `run_migration_pass` is the first real, non-test caller of
      `crate::reshard::bucket_moves` / `crate::reshard::
      snapshot_reshard_batches` (AC3), driving the `#1380` admin verbs
      (`POST /admin/backup:scoped`, `POST /admin/reshard:apply`, `POST
      /admin/reshard:evict`) against real shards via the injectable
      `ClusterControl::shard_base_url` seam. Independently leader-gated
      background loop (`spawn_reshard_driver_loop`) spawned alongside the
      existing live-usage loop from `reconcile::run`.

      and `should_start_split_true_on_fresh_post_cutover_usage_above_urgent`
      unit tests, exercising `should_start_split` against a status built via
      `LumenSpec::reshard_status_with_usage`'s new freshness-generation
      parameter. `should_start_split`/`drive_tick` themselves are
      unchanged — the freshness gate lives entirely in
      `reshard_status_with_usage`'s `blockingConditions` output, which this
      function's existing check already consumes.

      #1396 R1/R2/R3/R5: pre-land review fixes for cutover correctness.
      R1 re-sequences `advance_catching_up` (now `advance_catching_up` +
      new `advance_catching_up_fenced`) to migrate -> checkpoint the
      target-only -> evict sources -> checkpoint sources -> cutover, so no
      source eviction can become durable, or even be attempted, before the
      target's migrated data for the same pass is durably checkpointed
      (`checkpoint_touched_shards` generalized to `checkpoint_shards` over
      an explicit shard iterator, called twice per tick). R2 adds a
      bounded, status-visible write pause on still-moving buckets during
      the final `CatchingUp` pass via new `WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS`,
      `reshard_fence_call`, and `set_write_fence` (arm before the pass,
      unconditional clear after, on every exit path) against the new
      `api.rs` `POST /admin/reshard:fence` seam. R3 rewrites
      `checkpoint_shard` to parse the response body and require
      `persisted == true`; a 200 `{"persisted": false}` now bails with a
      shard-naming error, surfacing as `DriveOutcome::Blocked` rather than
      a satisfied durability gate. R5 adds a freshness re-check to
      `should_start_split`: `status.reshard.usage_measured_at_map_version`
      must equal `spec.shardMap.version`, so a lagging/stale status
      subresource can never start a split on its own. New/updated unit
      tests: `checkpoint_shard_blocked_when_response_reports_persisted_false`,
      `checkpoint_shard_blocked_when_response_omits_persisted_key`,
      `checkpoint_shard_ok_when_response_reports_persisted_true` (AC3),
      `should_start_split_false_on_stale_status_map_version`,
      `should_start_split_true_on_fresh_status_map_version` (AC5), and
      `status_with_blocking`'s fixture now sets
      `usage_measured_at_map_version` to stay fresh under the new R5 gate.

      #1442 R2: `advance_catching_up` no longer clears the write fence
      unconditionally on every exit path — when the outcome is
      `DriveOutcome::CompletedSplit`, the fence is left armed (bounded by
      `WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS`) instead of cleared immediately. A completed
      split just called `ClusterControl::trigger_rolling_restart`, but pods
      only read `SHARD_MAP_*`/`SHARD_COUNT` env at boot, so old-map pods
      keep serving (and would otherwise keep accepting local writes for) the
      just-evicted source buckets until the rolling restart actually reaches
      them; clearing the fence right after triggering the restart would
      reopen exactly that mixed-map window. Every other exit path (success
      without a completed split, or `Blocked`) still clears the fence
      immediately as before. Scope is limited to fence-through-restart
      sequencing only; new test
      `write_fence_stays_armed_immediately_after_completed_split` in
      `tests/reshard_driver_e2e.rs` covers the behavior.

      #1443 round-2 write-fence hardening (R1/R3/R4; R2's design lives in
      `projects-lumen-src-reshard-rs.md`/`projects-lumen-src-storage-rs.md`).
      R1 (TTL too short for a real pass): new private `FENCE_REARM_BATCH_INTERVAL`
      const plus a refactored `run_migration_pass_impl` re-arms the fence
      every `FENCE_REARM_BATCH_INTERVAL` applied batches during a long
      migration; `advance_catching_up_fenced` additionally re-arms
      immediately before the target checkpoint, before eviction, and before
      the source checkpoint — every step boundary in the fenced sequence now
      starts with a fresh TTL rather than relying on the single arm at the
      top of the pass. A failed re-arm at any of these points aborts the
      whole sequence to `DriveOutcome::Blocked` *before* the next
      (potentially destructive, e.g. evict) step runs — never proceeds on a
      possibly-expired fence. New public seam: `ClusterControl::
      write_fence_ttl_secs()` (default-impl trait method returning
      `WRITE_FENCE_TTL_SECS`) and the new `pub fn
      default_write_fence_ttl_secs()` free function that exposes that same
      default to integration tests building a `fence_ttl_secs: Option<u64>`
      override fixture. R3 (arm overflow panic): `set_write_fence`'s
      deadline computation now uses `Instant::checked_add` instead of `+`,
      returning a clean error instead of panicking on an out-of-range TTL;
      pairs with `api.rs`'s new `MAX_FENCE_TTL_SECS` request-validation gate
      so an invalid `ttl_secs` is rejected as 400 before it ever reaches this
      arithmetic. R4 (partial-arm leak): `set_write_fence` now tracks
      `armed_urls` as it arms each source shard in turn and, on the first
      failure, best-effort clears every shard it already armed before
      returning the error — a shard that failed to arm never leaves a sibling
      shard fenced with no driver retry in flight. New unit test
      `set_write_fence_clears_already_armed_shards_on_partial_failure`
      (AC4) proves this with a two-shard fake where shard A arms
      successfully and shard B is unreachable, asserting shard A receives
      exactly an arm call followed by a clear (empty-buckets) call. New e2e
      test `write_fence_survives_a_tick_longer_than_a_single_ttl` (AC1) in
      `tests/reshard_driver_e2e.rs` proves a fenced pass whose two sequential
      checkpoint calls together exceed a short TTL never lets a write through
      mid-pass.

      #1444 R2: an oversized single-document batch (`byte_cap_chunk`'s
      single-id floor case in `reshard.rs`, over
      `crate::reshard::ADMIN_ROUTE_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`) no longer wedges the
      split as a silent, permanently-recurring generic `Blocked` failure
      with a fence armed every tick. New `detect_oversized_batch` helper
      pre-flight-checks a batch's real wire size before `apply_reshard_batch`
      sends it (and as a defense-in-depth fallback on a live 413 response),
      returning a new `OversizedDocumentBlock` error (public struct,
      `Display`+`Error`, names the collection/external_id/byte count and
      carries remediation text). `run_migration_pass_impl` downcasts an
      `apply_reshard_batch` failure to `OversizedDocumentBlock` and records
      it (namespace/name-keyed, in-process `OversizeBlockCache`, mirroring
      `reconcile.rs`'s `ShardUsageCache` pattern) before propagating the
      error, and clears any recorded block on a pass that completes without
      hitting one (self-healing once an operator fixes the document).
      `advance_catching_up` now checks `should_skip_for_oversize` before
      arming the write-pause fence: a tick with a currently-recorded block
      short-circuits to `DriveOutcome::Blocked` without arming the fence,
      closing the recurring 503 write-window regression; a bounded
      `OVERSIZE_RECHECK_TICKS` budget still lets a real attempt through
      periodically so a since-fixed document is rediscovered. New public
      `oversize_block_condition(namespace, name)` read accessor lets
      `reconcile.rs`'s `status_patch` layer a distinct
      `"reshardOversizedDocument"` `status.reshard.blockingConditions`
      entry + remediation `message` onto the policy/usage-derived status.

      #1444 R2 AC2 test coverage: `record_oversize_block` and
      `clear_oversize_block` widened from private to `pub(crate)` (still not
      part of the crate's public API) so `reconcile.rs`'s `status_patch`
      tests can drive the exact `oversize_block_condition` cache. New unit
      tests: `detect_oversized_batch_none_when_under_limit` and
      `detect_oversized_batch_some_when_over_limit_names_first_id` prove the
      pre-flight size classification and first-offender selection;
      `apply_reshard_batch_rejects_oversized_batch_without_sending_request`
      proves the pre-flight check short-circuits before any HTTP call
      (`wiremock` `.expect(0)`); `oversize_block_cache_records_skips_then_
      exhausts_recheck_budget` proves the record/read/skip/exhaust/clear
      cache lifecycle end to end; `advance_catching_up_skips_fence_arm_when_
      oversize_wedge_recorded` proves a known-wedged tick reports `Blocked`
      without ever calling the fence route (`wiremock` `.expect(0)` on
      `/admin/reshard:fence`).

      #1458 round-3 fence/cutover lifecycle fix batch (R1/R3/R4; R2 lives in
      `api.rs`). R1: `Complete`-phase `drive_tick` now drives a new
      `advance_convergence` step (returns `DriveOutcome::
      AwaitingTopologyConvergence { map_version }` /
      `TopologyConverged { map_version }`) instead of falling straight
      through to `should_start_split`/`NoOp` — it re-arms the write-pause
      fence every tick the new topology is not yet confirmed converged
      (checked via the new `ClusterControl::serving_topology_converged`
      trait method, backed in production by the same kube readiness
      plumbing `KubeClusterControl` already uses), and clears the fence and
      persists `spec.reshardPolicy.workflow.convergedShardMapVersion` /
      `status.reshard.convergedShardMapVersion` once it is. Convergence
      state is derived entirely from this persisted field (not driver
      memory), so it is resumable across a driver restart; `reconcile.rs`'s
      `status_patch` surfaces an `awaitingTopologyConvergence` blocking
      condition whenever `spec.shardMap.version > 0` and
      `convergedShardMapVersion` has not caught up to it. New private
      helper `buckets_on_newest_shard` backs the desired-replica count
      `serving_topology_converged` is probed with. R3: the count-based
      `FENCE_REARM_BATCH_INTERVAL` const is retired in favor of a
      time-based `FENCE_REARM_FRACTION = 4` (re-arm once more than
      `write_fence_ttl_secs() / 4` has elapsed since the last arm), via a
      new shared `maybe_rearm_fence` helper called from both
      `run_migration_pass_impl` (between batch applies) and
      `checkpoint_shards` (around each shard's checkpoint/prune step); the
      existing phase-boundary re-arms in `advance_catching_up_fenced` are
      unchanged, and a failed re-arm still aborts to `Blocked` before the
      next step (including eviction) runs. R4: `OversizeBlockCache` is now
      keyed by the recording CR's `metadata.uid` (carried as the cached
      tuple's first element rather than folded into the map key, so the
      `(namespace, name)` key shape is unchanged) — `record_oversize_block`
      takes an explicit `uid` argument, `oversize_block_condition` and
      `should_skip_for_oversize` treat a cached entry whose `uid` does not
      match the caller's current `uid` as no entry, and a new `pub(crate)
      prune_oversize_cache(live_uids: &BTreeSet<String>)` drops any entry
      whose `uid` is no longer live, called from `spawn_reshard_driver_loop`
      every poll (which already lists every live CR cluster-wide) and
      whenever `drive_tick`'s `Complete` branch runs, bounding the cache
      across an unbounded number of delete-and-recreate cycles on the same
      `namespace/name`. New/updated unit tests: `oversize_block_cache_
      records_skips_then_exhausts_recheck_budget` and `advance_catching_up_
      skips_fence_arm_when_oversize_wedge_recorded` updated for the uid
      argument; all `ReshardWorkflowSpec { .. }` test-site struct literals
      gained `..Default::default()` for the new `converged_shard_map_
      version` field. New e2e coverage in `tests/reshard_driver_e2e.rs`:
      `FakeControl` gained a `serving_topology_converged` override
      (`with_topology_converged`) and a call counter;
      `full_split_resumes_after_restart_and_reaches_complete` asserts an
      explicit `TopologyConverged` tick before the final `NoOp`; new
      `fence_stays_armed_across_ticks_until_topology_convergence_confirmed`
      proves the fence stays armed (503 on the fenced bucket) across
      several `AwaitingTopologyConvergence` ticks, including across a
      simulated driver restart (fresh `FakeControl` over the same
      persisted `Lumen`), then clears (200) once convergence is confirmed
      and `convergedShardMapVersion` is persisted.
