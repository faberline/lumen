summary: >
  Align lumen's offline `llm` self-documentation with the repo-wide CLI
  convention so agents copy `lumen llm --topic <topic>` commands that the
  binary actually accepts.
capability_refs:
  - id: "cli-interface"
    role: primary
    gap: "lumen-llm-agent-topics-outline-workflow-integration-quickstart-recipes"
    claim: "lumen-llm-agent-topics-outline-workflow-integration-quickstart-recipes"
    coverage: partial
    rationale: "Keeps the offline llm topic surface copy-paste runnable through the standard `--topic` flag form."

    claim: "lumen-llm-agent-topics-outline-workflow-integration-quickstart-recipes"
    coverage: partial
    rationale: "Ensures the self-onboarding path advertised to agents matches the parser and does not fail on the first copied command."
