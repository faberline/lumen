// SPEC-MANAGED: apps/lumen/tech-design/semantic/source/projects-lumen-src-operator-reconcile-rs.md#rust-source-unit
// CODEGEN-BEGIN
//! lumen's operator wiring onto the shared `libs/operator` controller.
//!
//! The reconcile loop + leader-election lease now live in `libs/operator`
//! (`operator::run` drives the watch + leader-gated apply over h2c-free kube;
//! `operator::lease` is the elector). lumen supplies only its `ManagedService`
//! impl — what to render, which workloads to poll for readiness, and the
//! `Lumen` status subresource to write.
//!
//! Live per-shard storage-usage measurement (#1319 R1): `ManagedService::
//! status_patch` is synchronous and does no I/O by contract (shared with
//! keep/relay/loom via `libs/operator`), so it cannot itself poll pod
//! `/metrics` endpoints. Instead `run()` spawns a lumen-local background
//! loop (`spawn_shard_usage_loop`) that periodically scrapes every storage
//! pod's `lumen_storage_bytes` gauge over its headless-Service DNS name and
//! writes the per-shard max into an in-process cache; `status_patch` reads
//! that cache synchronously (best-effort — an empty/missing cache falls back
//! to the policy-only [`crate::operator::crd::LumenSpec::reshard_status`]).
//! This keeps the shared `libs/operator` trait untouched.
//!
//! This loop only *reports* a crossed `prepareAtPercent` / `urgentAtPercent`
//! threshold in `status.reshard`; a second, independently leader-gated
//! background loop spawned alongside it — [`crate::operator::reshard_driver::
//! spawn_reshard_driver_loop`] (#1319 R2, #1381) — is what actually drives
//! `workflow.phase` and moves data once a threshold is crossed.
//!
//! ## Post-cutover usage freshness (#1386)
//!
//! Each [`ShardUsageSnapshot`] the loop below writes into the cache is
//! tagged with `spec.shardMap.version` as read off the very same CR the
//! scrape was addressed against — the freshness generation
//! [`crate::operator::crd::LumenSpec::reshard_status_with_usage`] compares
//! against the CR's *current* `shard_map.version` before ever reporting a
//! crossed threshold. Without this, a split's `Complete` cutover (which
//! bumps `shard_map.version`) races this loop's own
//! [`SHARD_USAGE_POLL_INTERVAL`] cadence: the cache can still hold a
//! pre-cutover, pre-eviction reading for up to that whole interval, and
//! [`crate::operator::reshard_driver::should_start_split`] would otherwise
//! re-fire off that stale number the very next driver tick — the live bug
//! #1384's kind proof caught (a second split starting 20s after the first
//! one's `Complete`, purely off a reading taken before the eviction that
//! same cutover had just performed). Neither loop needs to synchronize
//! with the other directly: the generation tag alone is enough, and it
//! survives an operator failover the same way every other reshard
//! checkpoint does — it rides on the CR itself (`status.reshard.
//! usageMeasuredAtMapVersion`, freshly recomputed by whichever replica
//! next runs `status_patch`), never in this loop's or the driver's
//! in-process state.
//!
//! ## HPA topology-transition handoff (#1385)
//!
//! [`render::render`] stops emitting a HorizontalPodAutoscaler once the CR's
//! shape no longer wants one ([`render::wants_hpa`] — today, `shardCount >
//! 1`), but `libs/operator`'s shared reconcile contract (`libs/operator::
//! service`) deliberately does not prune children across a render-shape
//! change — that handoff is left to the service. A third independently
//! leader-gated background loop, [`spawn_hpa_handoff_loop`], is lumen's side
//! of that handoff: every tick it lists every `Lumen` CR and, for any whose
//! current shape no longer wants an HPA, deletes the previously-rendered one
//! if it is still there — scoped and idempotent (R2: only an object whose
//! live name *and* labels match what [`render::hpa_labels`] would have
//! stamped; a missing HPA, or one that doesn't look lumen-rendered, is a
//! no-op, not an error). Without this, the stale single-member HPA (clamped
//! to `minReplicas`/`maxReplicas` == 1 by #1317) keeps scaling the serving
//! StatefulSet back down to one ready replica, permanently starving
//! [`crate::operator::reshard_driver`]'s `PrepareSplit` readiness gate
//! (`readyReplicas >= targetShardCount`) — observed live in #1384's kind
//! proof, unblocked there only by a manual `kubectl delete hpa`.
