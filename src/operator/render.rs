//! Pure rendering: a [`Lumen`] spec → the set of child Kubernetes objects that
//! realize it. No cluster, no I/O — every object is a self-contained
//! `serde_json::Value` carrying `apiVersion`, `kind`, full `metadata` (labels +
//! owner reference), and `spec`/`data`. This is the operator's source of truth
//! and its primary test surface: assert the rendered objects, no kind needed.
//!
//! The objects mirror `k8s/base` + the staging/prod overlays exactly: a
//! serving StatefulSet (always — its `volumeClaimTemplates`-backed `raft` PVC
//! is the WAL's only durable home, even at `replicasPerShard:1`), its
//! headless Service, a ClusterIP Service, ConfigMap, PDB, serving
//! ServiceAccount, and a dedicated backup ServiceAccount. The backup identity
//! is intentionally cloud-neutral: deployment harnesses may annotate it for
//! Workload Identity without giving object-storage credentials to serving
//! pods.
//! Stateful data pods are not a direct HPA target. The reconcile loop in [`super::reconcile`]
//! server-side-applies whatever this returns.

// not published to Prometheus by any customresourcestate config this
// operator ships, so this alert reads the driver's write-fence instead
// (`lumen_reshard_fence_active`/`_armed_unixtime`, `src/api.rs`'s
// `reshard_fence` handler) — it only catches a fence left armed past the
// fenced final `CatchingUp` pass's expected duration, not an early stall in
// `PrepareSplit`/`Splitting` (which never arms a fence at all). A full fix
// needs either a customresourcestate config or a driver-side liveness gauge
// and is out of this WI's scope. `LumenSlowQueries` (#2519) reads
// `lumen_slow_queries_total` (`src/metrics.rs`'s `Metrics::observe_search`),
// incremented once per search whose latency meets or exceeds the
// `LUMEN_SLOW_QUERY_MS` threshold (default 500ms).
