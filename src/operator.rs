// CODEGEN-BEGIN
//! K8s Operator for lumen: a `Lumen` custom resource ([`crd`]), plus a reconcile loop ([`reconcile`])
//! that renders ([`render`]) and applies the serving data-plane.
//!
//! The operator consumes externally provisioned TLS Secrets; it does not own
//! certificate issuer configuration or lifecycle.
//!
//! ```text
//! Lumen (lumen.dev/v1alpha1)  --reconcile-->  ServiceAccount, ConfigMap,
//!                                             Deployment/StatefulSet, Service,
//!                                             PDB,
//!                                             [ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule]

/// also unnecessary: Kubernetes prunes an explicitly-null field before CEL runs,
/// so `has()` already reports it absent. Presence tests plus `size()`, nothing
/// else.
