// CODEGEN-BEGIN
//! Local append-only log (Stage 2 Phase 2f-3) — the binary's "AOF".
//!
//! The segment checkpoint ([`crate::segment_rdb`]) is the binary's "RDB": a
//! periodic, atomic snapshot of the materialized index, tagged with the WAL
//! sequence `S` it is current as of. Between checkpoints, this file is the
//! durable record of every APPLIED `(seq, WalRecord)` — the exact Redis
//! RDB+AOF split. Recovery is:
//!
//! 1. **RDB** — reopen the newest segment checkpoint (engine seeded to seq `S`),
//! 2. **AOF** — replay every frame with `seq > S` into the engine (to seq `A`),
//! 3. **Broker** — tail the log from `A + 1`.
//!
//! Because the AOF is durable through `A`, the broker stream only needs retention
//! beyond `A`, not from seq 0 — which is the whole point: broker retention can be
//! TRIMMED instead of kept forever.
//!
//! ## Frame format
//!
//! Each appended record is one self-describing frame:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ seq : u64 LE ][ len : u32 LE ][ crc : u32 LE ][ payload : len bytes ]
//! ```
//!
//! - `seq`     — the global sequence the record was applied at (the order key).
//! - `len`     — payload length in bytes.
//! - `crc`     — `crc32(payload)` (crc32fast), checked on replay.
//! - `payload` — the [`WalRecord`] encoded with ciborium (a compact, stable CBOR
//!   form — the same codec the segment checkpoint sidecars and CBOR RDB use).
//!
//! The 16-byte fixed header lets replay detect a TORN TAIL without parsing the
//! payload: if fewer than 16 header bytes remain, or `len` overruns EOF, or the
//! crc mismatches, the frame is incomplete (a crash landed mid-append) — replay
//! stops cleanly at the last good frame, with no panic and no error. The byte
//! offset of that last good frame's end is recorded so the next
//! [`AofWriter::open`] can truncate the torn tail before appending.
//!
//! ## fsync policy
//!
//! Mirrors Redis `appendfsync`:
//!
//! - [`FsyncPolicy::EverySec`] — append writes to the OS buffer; a
//!   periodic [`AofWriter::maybe_sync`] (call-driven, off the apply hot path)
//!   fsyncs at most once per second. A crash loses at most ~1s of un-fsynced
//!   tail, which replay recovers as a torn tail (the frames are still in the OS
//!   page cache up to the crash point, and any partial frame is discarded).
//! - [`FsyncPolicy::Always`] (default) — fsync after every append.

// THE CRUX: RDB + AOF recovery WITHOUT broker replay (Stage 2 Phase 2f-3).
//
// The whole durability story end-to-end, with the log out of the picture:
//
//   1. A "live" engine applies ops 1..=A via `apply_raft_entry`, with every op
//      ALSO appended to an AOF.
//   2. At seq S (< A) the segment checkpoint is taken (`flush_to_segments`) and
//      the AOF is `truncate_through(S)`d — so on disk the RDB covers 1..=S and
//      the AOF covers S+1..=A.
//   3. "Restart": a FRESH engine reopens the segment dir (recovers to S), then
//      `replay_aof_into` replays S+1..=A (recovers to A).
//
// The restarted engine's query results — result sets, byte-identical f32 scores,
// retrieved field values, and ordered kNN — must equal the live engine at A. If
// the frame crc/len decode, the seq-skip boundary, or `truncate_through` is
// wrong, recovery diverges (or the torn-tail path panics) and this test fails.

//    fill its budget, append the next create/index frame, and start replay on a
//    thread. Assert the query and capture sequence remain at the prefix while
//    the replay thread blocks. Drive the independent checkpoint, join replay,
//    then assert the new document and its exact sequence are present after cold
//    reopen.
//
// 2. replay_preparation_error_keeps_frame_and_watermark:
//    arrange a record whose admitted prepared-text staging fails through the
//    existing test failure seam. Assert replay returns Err, its sequence stays
//    at the prefix, and a second AOF reader still returns that same frame.
