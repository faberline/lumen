# Fleet and runtime configuration

## Fleet and runtime configuration

- Problem: Fleet instances need safe, explicit runtime configuration and convergence.
- Who: Fleet operators.
- Promise: Fleet materializes declared instances and current override, environment, argument, rollout, readiness, pruning, and readiness-dimension surfaces.
- Status rows: `fleet-instance-materialization`, `fleet-lumen-spec-overrides`, `fleet-extra-environment`, `fleet-extra-arguments`, `fleet-safe-rollout`, `fleet-runtime-readiness-aggregation`, `fleet-child-pruning`, `runtime-readiness-dimensions`.
- Limits today: Fleet convergence and production rollout guarantees are future work.
- Non-goals: Reserved identity, topology, storage, or security overrides.
- Neighbours: Topology owns in-runtime quorum transitions.

## Runtime configuration parity (Milestone #24)

- Problem: Standalone and Managed configuration can diverge.
- Who: Runtime and Fleet operators.
- Promise: Both paths use one classified configuration contract.
- Outcome: `runtime-configuration-parity`. Tracking: [Milestone #24](https://github.com/chrischeng-c4/axiom/milestone/24).
- Non-goals: Unrestricted raw overrides.
- Open: Classify every option and restart effect.
- Neighbours: Fleet production convergence.

## Fleet production convergence (Milestone #38)

- Problem: Fleet needs durable, observable convergence across runtimes.
- Who: Fleet operators.
- Promise: Fleet converges declared instances and publishes complete readiness.
- Outcome: `fleet-production-convergence`. Tracking: [Milestone #38](https://github.com/chrischeng-c4/axiom/milestone/38).
- Non-goals: Replacing in-runtime Raft safety.
- Open: Define recovery and aggregate readiness evidence.
- Neighbours: Fleet safe rollout and foundation extraction.

## Fleet safe rollout (Milestone #40)

- Problem: Fleet changes need a safe rollout boundary.
- Who: Fleet operators.
- Promise: Fleet rolls declared changes forward only when readiness evidence permits.
- Outcome: `fleet-safe-rollout`. Tracking: [Milestone #40](https://github.com/chrischeng-c4/axiom/milestone/40).
- Non-goals: Using workload ordering as a quorum proof.
- Open: Define per-instance rollout controls.
- Neighbours: Quorum-safe runtime rollout.

## Fleet foundation extraction (Milestone #37)

- Problem: Fleet-specific foundations must be reusable without moving Lumen policy out of the app.
- Who: Fleet and platform maintainers.
- Promise: The shared Fleet foundation has a clear reusable boundary.
- Outcome: `fleet-foundation-extraction`. Tracking: [Milestone #37](https://github.com/chrischeng-c4/axiom/milestone/37).
- Non-goals: Extracting Lumen search or Raft policy into a generic library.
- Open: Define the reusable API and migration boundary.
- Neighbours: Fleet production convergence.

## Non-goals in this area

Fleet does not replace stateful membership safety with generic rollout order.
