// HANDWRITE gap="missing-generator:e2e-test:retired-credential-surface" tracker="2875" reason="A residue gate has to read the repository as text, hold a reviewed exclusion list, and avoid matching its own source; no generator primitive emits that shape."
//! #2875: phase 1's closing gate — the retired credential model leaves no
//! mention behind that reads as current behaviour.
//!
//! Phase 1 removed the bearer credential model from five surfaces in five
//! separate work items. Retirement split that way finishes at ninety percent,
//! and the ten percent is never logic — it is a README paragraph, an overlay,
//! a design note. Nothing fails when a document still tells a reader to set an
//! environment variable that no longer exists, so nothing does, and the
//! surviving mention becomes the documentation of record for whoever finds it
//! next.
//!
//! This file turns "we deleted it" into a machine answer.
//!
//! # What an exclusion means here
//!
//! A surviving mention is only acceptable when it is *about* the removal: a
//! negative assertion whose deletion would delete the proof, or a migration
//! note describing behaviour that is gone. Those are listed below, each with
//! the reason it survives and the exact number of lines it may occupy.
//!
//! The line count is the part that matters. A bare path exclusion turns a file
//! into a blind spot — the very first place a re-grown credential path would
//! land, because the gate already agreed not to look there. Pinning the count
//! means a file that is allowed two retirement notes cannot quietly acquire a
//! third line that hands someone a credential recipe. Changing a count is a
//! deliberate edit that shows up in review; that is the whole point. A stale
//! entry — one that matches nothing — fails too, so the list shrinks as the
//! notes age out. An empty list is the goal.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! `apps/lumen` and `acceptance`. Deliberately not swept:
//!
//! - `libs/service-auth` — `apps/courier`, `apps/defer` and `apps/keep` link
//!   its registry types. Those symbols are legitimately alive.
//! - `libs/cli-std` — `apps/beam` still consumes the credential helpers. lumen
//!   stopped calling them; nothing was removed.
//! - `libs/service-k8s` — one test fixture uses a retired variable name as
//!   example env, not product wiring. It also belongs to a paused session's
//!   modified set and must not be touched from this chain (#2880).
